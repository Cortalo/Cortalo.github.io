## Upper and Lower Bound

Def: Let $$S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$$ and $$r \in \mathbb{R}$$. We say that

(1) $$r$$ is an upper (resp. lower) of $$S$$ if

$$
\forall s \in S [ r \ge (\text{ resp. } \le)  s]
$$

(2) $$r$$ is a greatest (resp. least) element of $$S$$ if:

- &nbsp; 1. $$r$$ is a upper (resp. lower) bound of $$S$$.

- &nbsp; 2. $$r \in S$$

Notation: $$r = \max S$$ (resp. $$\min S$$)

(3) $$r$$ is the least upper (greatest lower) bound of $$S$$, if

$$
r = \min \{u\in \mathbb{R} \vert u \text{ is a upper bound of } S\} = \sup S
$$

$$
r = \max \{u\in \mathbb{R} \vert u \text{ is a lower bound of } S\} = \inf S
$$

We have

- if $$r = \sup S$$, then any $$u < r$$, $$u$$ is not upper bound of $$S$$.

- if $$r = \inf S$$, then any $$u > r$$, $$u$$ is not lower bound of $$S$$.

Also, every $$r \in \mathbb{R}$$ is a upper and lower bound of $$\emptyset$$.

Convention:

- We write $$\sup S = \infty$$ (resp. $$\inf S = -\infty$$) if and only if $$S$$ has no upper (resp. lower) bound.
If this is the case we say $$\sup S$$ (resp. $$\inf S$$) doesn't exist.

- We way $$S$$ is bounded from above (resp. below) iff $$S$$ has a upper (lower) bound.

## Dedekind Cut

Def (Dedekind Cut): Let $$A, B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$$, we say that $$(A,B)$$ is a Dedekind cut (of $$\mathbb{R}$$) if

- &nbsp; $$A \ne \emptyset \ne B$$

- &nbsp; $$A \cup B = \mathbb{R}$$

- &nbsp; $$\forall a \in A, b \in B, [a < b]$$

We usually call $$A$$ (resp. $$B$$) the lower (resp. upper) part of $$(A,B)$$.

From now on (until he say stop) we assume that $$\mathbb{R}$$ has the following property:

(Dedekind's gapless property) If $$(A,B)$$ is a D-cut of $$\mathbb{R}$$, then exactly one of the following happens:

- &nbsp; $$\max A$$ exists but $$\min B$$ doesn't.

- &nbsp; $$\min B$$ exists but $$\max A$$ doesn't

Ex 1: We may define Dedekind cuts of $$\mathbb{Q}$$ similarly.

$$
B = \{x \in \mathbb{Q} \vert x > 0 \land x^2 > 2\}, A = Q \backslash B
$$

We can verify it is D-cut.

We can prove $$ \max A, \min B$$ doesn't exists.

If $$\min B$$ exists, let $$\min B = p$$.

$$
\min B = p \implies p \in B \implies  p > 0 \land p^2 > 2
$$

Let $$q = p - \dfrac{p^2-2}{2p} \implies 0 < q < p$$

$$
q^2 = \Big( p - \dfrac{p^2-2}{2p}\Big)^2 = 2 + \Big(\dfrac{p^2-2}{2p}\Big)^2 > 2
$$

$$q > 0 \land q^2 > 2 \land q \in \mathbb{Q} \implies q \in B$$

contradicts with $$ q < p = \min B$$

If $$\max A$$ exists, let $$\max A = p$$

$$
\max A = p \implies p \in A \implies p^2 < 2
$$

$$
1 \in A \implies p \ge 1 > 0
$$

Let $$ h = \min\Big( \dfrac{1}{2}, \dfrac{2-p^2}{2p+2}\Big)$$

$$
h \le \dfrac{1}{2} < 1
$$

$$
h \le \dfrac{2-p^2}{2p+2} < \dfrac{2-p^2}{2p+1}
$$

$$
(p+h)^2 = p^2 + (2p+h)h < p^2 + (2p+1)h < p^2 + (2-p^2) < 2
$$

$$
p + h \in Q \land (p+h)^2 < 2 \implies p+h \in A
$$

contraditcs with $$p+h > p = \max A$$

## Weierstrass

Theorem (Weierstrass): Let $$\emptyset \ne S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$$. If $$S$$ has a upper bound, then $$\sup S$$ exists.

Proof:

Let $$B := \{b \in \mathbb{R} \vert b \text{ is a upper bound of } S\}, A:= \mathbb{R} \backslash B $$

We need to show that $$\min B$$ exists.

Step 1: $$(A,B)$$ is a D-cut of $$\mathbb{R}$$

- &nbsp; $$A \ne \emptyset \ne B$$

$$S \ne \emptyset \implies s \in S \implies s-1 \not\in B \implies s - 1 \in A \implies A \ne \emptyset$$

$$ S \text{ has a upper bound } \implies B \ne \emptyset $$

- &nbsp; $$A \cup B = \mathbb{R}$$

- &nbsp; $$\forall a \in A, b \in B, [a < b]$$.

Were this false, $$a \ge b$$

$$
b \in B \implies a \in B \implies a \in A \cap B \implies a \in \emptyset
$$

Step 2: We need to show that $$\max A$$ doesn't exists. Were this false.

$$
\max A = a_0 \implies a_0 \in A \implies a_0 \text{ is not an upper bound of} S \implies \exists s_0 \in S \text{ s.t. } s_0 > a_0
$$

Let $$h = \dfrac{a_0 + s_0}{2}, a_0 < h < s_0$$

$$
h < s_0 \implies h \text{ is not an upper bound of } S \implies h \in A
$$

contracts with $$ h > a_0 = \max A$$

## The Archimedean Property

Ex2: prove the following statement

(The Archimedean property) $$\forall r \in \mathbb{R} [r > 0 \implies \exists n \in N [\frac{1}{n} < r]]$$

Step 1: We need to show $$\mathbb{N}$$ doesn't have upper bound. Were this false, $$\mathbb{N}$$ has upper bound, then from Weierstrass $$\sup \mathbb{N}$$ exists, $$b = \sup \mathbb{N} = \min \{\text{ uppber bound of } \mathbb{N}\}$$.


$$
\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, [n+1 \in \mathbb{N}]
$$

$$
n+1 \in \mathbb{N} \implies n + 1 \le b \implies n \le b - 1
$$

$$
\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, [n \le b - 1]
$$

thus $$b - 1$$ is an uppber bound of $$\mathbb{N}$$, $$b - 1 \in \{ \text{ upper bound of } \mathbb{N}\}$$ contracdicts with

$$b - 1 < b = \min \{ \text{ uppber bound of } \mathbb{N} \}$$

Step 2: Were Archimedean property false

$$
\exists r \in \mathbb{R} \land r > 0 [\forall n \in \mathbb{N} [\frac{1}{n} \ge r]]
$$

thus

$$
\exists r \in \mathbb{R} \land r > 0 [\forall n \in \mathbb{N} [n \le \frac{1}{r}]]
$$

thus $$1/r$$ is an upper bound of $$\mathbb{N}$$

## Limit of Sequence

Def: Let $$a_n (n \in \mathbb{N})$$ be a sequence in $$\mathbb{R}$$, and $$L \in \mathbb{R}$$.
We say that $$a_n$$ converges to $$L$$ (as $$n \to \infty$$) if

$$
\forall \varepsilon > 0 \quad \exists N \in \mathbb{N} \quad [n \ge N \implies \vert a_n - L \vert < \varepsilon]
$$

Terminology: If such $$L$$ exists (doesn't exists), we call it the limit of $$a_n$$ and we call $$a_n$$ a convergent (divergent) sequence.

Notation: $$\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = L$$
