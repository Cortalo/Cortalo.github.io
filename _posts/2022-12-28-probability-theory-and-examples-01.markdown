# Measure Theory

## Probability Spaces

Here and throughout the book, terms being defined are set in **boldface**.

Here and in what follows, **countable** means finite or countably infinite.

 **$$\sigma$$-field**(or **$$\sigma$$-algebra**) $$\mathcal{F}$$ is a (nonempty) collection of subsets of $$\Omega$$ that satisfy

(i) if $$A \in \mathcal{F}$$ then $$A^c \in \mathcal{F}$$, and

(ii) if $$A_i \in \mathcal{F}$$ is a countable sequence of sets then $$\cup_i A_i \in \mathcal{F}$$.

Since $$\cap_i A_i = (\cup_i A_i^c)^c$$, it follows that a $$\sigma$$-field is closed under countable intersections.

$$(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$$ is called a **measurable space**, i.e., it is a space on which we can put a measure.

A **measure** is a nonnegative countably additive set function; that is, a function $$\mu: \mathcal{F} \to \mathbf{R}$$ with

(i) $$\mu(A) \ge \mu(\emptyset)$$ for all $$A \in \mathcal{F}$$, and

(ii) if $$A_i \in \mathcal{F}$$ is a countable sequence of disjoint sets, then

$$
\mu(\cup_i A_i) = \sum_{i}\mu(A_i)
$$

If $$\mu(\Omega) = 1$$, we call $$\mu$$ a **probability measure**.
In this book, probability measures are usually denoted by $$P$$.

<!-- A **probability space** is a triple $$(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$$ where $$\Omega$$ is a set of "outcomes," $$\mathcal{F}$$ is $$\sigma$$-field (or $$\sigma$$-algebra), and $$P: \mathcal{F} \to [0,1]$$ is a function that assigns probabilities to events. -->

**Theorem 1.1.1.**
Let $$\mu$$ be a measure on $$(\Omega,\mathcal{F})$$

(i) **monotonicity**. If $$A \subset B$$ then $$\mu(A) \le \mu(B)$$.

(ii) **subadditivity**. If $$A \subset \cup_{m=1}^{\infty} A_m$$ then $$\mu(A) \le \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \mu(A_m)$$.

(iii) **continuity from below**. If $$A_i \uparrow A$$ (i.e., $$A_1 \subset A_2 \subset \dots$$ and $$\cup_i A_i = A$$) then $$\mu(A_i) \uparrow \mu(A)$$.

(iv) **continuity from above**. If $$A_i \downarrow A$$ (i.e., $$A_1 \supset A_2 \supset \dots$$ and $$\cap_i A_i = A$$), with $$\mu(A_1) < \infty$$ then $$\mu(A_i) \downarrow \mu(A)$$.

*Proof*.
(i) Let $$B - A = B \cap A^c$$ be the **difference** of the two sets.
Using $$+$$ to denote disjoint union, $$B = A + (B-A)$$ so

$$
\mu(B) = \mu(A) + \mu(B-A) \ge \mu(A)
$$

**Lemma**.
Let $$I \ne \emptyset$$ is an arbitrary index set (i.e., possibly uncountable).
If $$\mathcal{F}_i, i \in I$$ are $$\sigma$$-fieldm then $$\cap_{i\in I} \mathcal{F}_i$$ is $$\sigma$$-field.

*Proof*.
(i) If $$A \in \cap_{i \in I} \mathcal{F}_i$$, then $$A \in \mathcal{F}_i, \forall i$$.
It follows $$A^c \in \mathcal{F}_i, \forall i$$, and $$A^c \in \cap_{i\in I} \mathcal{F}_i$$.

(ii) Similarily if $$A_j \in \cap_{i\in I}\mathcal{F}$$ is a countable sequence of sets, then $$\cup_{j} A_j \in \cap_{i \in I} \mathcal{F}$$.

Frorm this it follows that if we are given a set $$\Omega$$ and a collection $$\mathcal{A}$$ of subsets of $$\Omega$$, then there is a smallest $$\sigma$$-field containing $$\mathcal{A}$$.
We will call this the **$$\sigma$$-field generated by $$\mathcal{A}$$** and denote it by $$\sigma(A)$$.

Let $$\mathcf{R}^d$$ btthe set of vectors $$(x_1,\dots,x_d)$$ of real numbers
