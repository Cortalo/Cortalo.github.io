## Write Good Code

The idea of extracting functions needs practice.
Here is another example.
It multiply each elements in the list by n.

```scheme
(define (scale-list n l)
  (if (null? l)
      nil
      (cons (* (car l) n)
            (scale-list n (cdr l)))
      )
 )
```

We should write such function using map.
```scheme
(define (scale-list n l)
  (map (lambda(x) (* n x)) l)
)
```
