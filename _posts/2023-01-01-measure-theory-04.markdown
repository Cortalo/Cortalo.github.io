# Caratheodory's Extension Theorem

We already know given a $$\sigma$$-additive $$\mu: \mathscr{S} \to [0,\infty]$$, there is an unique extension to an algebra with $$\sigma$$-additive $$\nu: \mathscr{A}(\mathscr{S}) \to [0,\infty]$$, with $$\nu(A) = \mu(A) \forall A \in \mathscr{A}(\mathscr{S})$$, in fact, the set function is

$$
\nu(E) = \sum_{j=1}^{n}\mu(E_j)
$$

where $$E_j \in \mathscr{S}$$ and they are disjoint.

Next we will prove, given a $$\sigma$$-additive $$\nu: \mathscr{A} \to [0,\infty]$$, if $$\Omega$$ is $$\nu$$ $$\sigma$$-finite, then there is an unique extension to an $$\sigma$$-algebra $$\pi: \mathscr{F}(\mathscr{A}) \to [0,\infty]$$, with $$\pi(A) = \nu(A) \forall A \in \mathscr{A}$$.


We would

- first define a set funtion on the whole $$\mathscr{P}(\Omega)$$, called $$\pi^{*}: \mathscr{P}(\Omega) \to \mathbb{R}_+ \cup \{\infty\}$$.

- we can show $$\pi^{*}$$ is an outer-measure, although it is not $$\sigma$$-additive.

- then we will define a set $$\mathscr{M} \subseteq \mathscr{P}(\Omega)$$, such that

  - it satisfies $$\mathscr{M}$$ is an $$\sigma$$-algebra and $$\mathscr{M} \supseteq \mathscr{A}$$

  - it satisfies $$\pi^* \vert_{\mathscr{M}}$$ is $$\sigma$$-additive

  - it satisfies $$\pi^* \vert_{\mathscr{A}(\mathscr{S})} = \nu$$

  - does $$\mathscr{M} = \mathscr{F}(\mathscr{A})$$? No, we can see example that $$\mathscr{M}$$ is strictly bigger than $$\mathscr{F}(\mathscr{A})$$

## Outer Measure

A set function $$\mu: \mathscr{C} \to \mathbb{R}_+ \cup \{\infty\}$$ is an outer measure if and only if


(i) $$\mu(\emptyset) = 0$$

(ii) $$E \subseteq F, E, F \in \mathscr{C} \quad \implies \quad \mu(E) \le \mu(F)$$

(iii) $$\mu$$ is countable monotone: if $$\{E_j\}_{j=1}^{\infty}$$ is a countable covering of $$E$$, then $$\mu(E) \le \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \mu(E_j)$$.

## Step 1

We define a set function on the whole $$\mathscr{P}(\Omega)$$, namely $$\pi^*: \mathscr{P}(\Omega) \to [0,\infty]$$

$$
\pi^*(A) = \inf_{\{E_i\}} \sum_{i \ge 1} \nu(E_i)
$$

where $$\{E_i\}_{i \ge 1}$$ is a countable covering of $$A$$ in $$\mathscr{A}(\mathscr{S})$$, i.e., $$E_i \in \mathscr{A}(\mathscr{S})$$ and $$A \subseteq \cup_{i \ge 1} E_i$$.
And the function $$\pi^*$$ is defined as the inf value for all possible covering of $$A$$.

**Proof:** $$\pi^* : \mathscr{P}(\Omega) to [0,1]$$ is an outer measure.

## Step 2

Define a set $$\mathscr{M}$$ (measurable subset). If $$A \in \mathscr{M}$$, then $$\forall E \subseteq \Omega, \pi^*(E) = \pi^*(E \cap A) + \pi^*(E \cap A^c)$$.

- we can prove it satisfies $$\mathscr{M}$$ is an $$\sigma$$-algebra and $$\mathscr{M} \supseteq \mathscr{A}(\mathscr{S})$$

- Thus $$\mathscr{M} \supseteq \mathscr{F}(\mathscr{S})$$.

## Step 3

Consider $$\pi^* \vert_{\mathscr{M}}: \mathscr{M} \to [0,\infty]$$.

- it satisfies $$\pi^* \vert_{\mathscr{M}}$$ is $$\sigma$$-additive

- it satisfies $$\pi^* \vert_{\mathscr{A}(\mathscr{S})} = \nu$$

## Step 4

For any two $$\mu_1, \mu_2: \mathscr{F}(\mathscr{A}) \to [0,\infty]$$, if $$\mu_1 \vert_{\mathscr{A}} = \mu_2 \vert_{\mathscr{A}}$$, and if $$\Omega$$ is $$\sigma$$-finite on $$\mu_1 \vert_{\mathscr{A}} (\text{or } \mu_2 \vert_{\mathscr{A}})$$, then

$$
\mu_1 = \mu_2
$$

### $$\sigma$$-Finite

If $$\Omega$$ is $$\sigma$$-finite on $$\mu: \mathscr{C} \to [0,\infty]$$, it means

$$
\exists \text{ countable } \{E_j\}_{j=1}^{\infty}, E_j \in \mathscr{C}, E_j \uparrow \Omega, \text{ and } \mu(E_j) < \infty \forall j < \infty
$$

## Monotone Class

Define, $$\mathscr{G} \subseteq \mathscr{P}(\Omega)$$ is a monotone class if and only of

(i) $$A_j \in \mathscr{G} \forall j \ge 1$$ and $$A_j \subseteq A_{j+1} \quad \implies \quad \cup_{j \ge 1}A_j \in \mathscr{G}$$.

(ii) $$B_j \in \mathscr{G} \forall j \ge 1$$ and $$B_j \supseteq B_{j+1} \quad \implies \quad \cap_{j \ge 1}B_j \in \mathscr{G}$$.

**Observations:**

- $$\mathscr{G}_{\alpha}$$ is monotone class, where $$\alpha \in I$$ and $$I$$ is any index set. Then $$\cap_{\alpha \in I} \mathscr{G}_{\alpha}$$ is a monotone class.

- So we can talk about the smallest monotone class $$\mathscr{M}(\mathscr{C})$$ generated by a class $$\mathscr{C}$$ (contain $$\mathscr{C}$$).

## Lemma

Given algebra $$\mathscr{A} \subseteq \mathscr{P}(\Omega)$$, then

$$
\mathscr{M}(\mathscr{A}) = \mathscr{F}(\mathscr{A})
$$

## Summary

Given $$\nu: \mathscr{A} \to [0,\infty]$$ and $$\Omega$$ is $$\nu$$ $$\sigma$$-finite.
Then there is an unique extantion $$\pi: \mathscr{F}(\mathscr{A}): [0,\infty]$$ with $$\pi(A) = \nu(A) \forall A \in \mathscr{A}$$.
We define

$$
\begin{align}
\pi^*&: \mathscr{P}(\Omega) \to [0,\infty]\\
\pi^*(A) &= \inf_{\{E_i\}} \sum_{i \ge 1} \nu(E_i)
\end{align}
$$

where $$\{E_i\}$$ is covering of $$A$$.
Then

$$
\pi = \pi^* \vert_{\mathscr{F}(\mathscr{A})}
$$
