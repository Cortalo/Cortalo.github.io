All the signals has sampling rate $$F_s$$

The white noise with zero mean and $$\sigma^2$$ variance, it has PSD

$$
S(f) = \dfrac{\sigma^2}{F_s / 2}
$$

Discrete-Time Integration

  $$
\dfrac{1}{1-z^{-1}}
$$

$$
\bigg\vert \dfrac{1}{1-e^{-j2\pi f / F_s}} \bigg\vert^2 \approx \bigg\vert \dfrac{1}{2\pi f / F_s} \bigg\vert^2
$$
