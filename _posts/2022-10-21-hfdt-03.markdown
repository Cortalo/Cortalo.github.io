## Quality Factors

The Q of an inductor or capacitor is the ratio of its reactance to its resistance.

### Example 01

A inductor and a resistor in series

$$
Q = \frac{\omega L}{R}
$$

### Example 02

A capacitor and a resistor in series

$$
Q = \frac{1}{\omega CR}
$$


> In general $$Q$$ will depend on frequency $$\omega$$

### Example 03

Four elements $$L, R_L, C, R_C$$ in series, at the resonant frequency $$\omega_0$$

$$
Q = \frac{\omega_0 L}{R_L + R_C} = \frac{1}{\omega_0 C (R_L + R_C)}
$$
