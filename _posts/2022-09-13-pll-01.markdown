_PLL Typical Architecture_

### Type-I PLL

![002](/assets/img/2022-09-13-pll-01/002.png)

The PLL using XOR as PD is an example of type-I PLL, since there is only one integrator (the VCO) in the loop.

XOR is called PD since phase detectos produce little information if thet sense unequal frequencies at their inputs.

### Type-II PLL

The PLL using PFD/CP is an example of type-II PLL, since there are two integrators in the loop.

$$
\begin{align}
K_d &= \dfrac{I_{cp}}{2\pi}\\
F_{LF}(s) &= R + \dfrac{1}{sC}
\end{align}
